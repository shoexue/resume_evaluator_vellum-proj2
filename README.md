# ü§ñ Resume Analyzer & AI Recruiter Feedback Tool

Hiring is hard. Giving thoughtful feedback to every applicant is even harder.

This AI-powered web app makes that part effortless. Upload a **resume** and a **job description**, and the app instantly analyzes fit and delivers a tailored email‚Äîeither inviting the candidate to the next round or providing clear, respectful rejection feedback.

Unlike traditional resume parsers, this tool doesn‚Äôt just scrape keywords. It **understands intent**, **evaluates qualifications**, and ensures **every candidate walks away with an answer**.

Built with **Flask**, **React**, and **Vellum AI**, this project brings recruiter intelligence to scale‚Äîwithout losing the human touch.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Vellum Was Used

At the core of the system is a custom **Vellum `router_classifier` workflow** that drives all logic and messaging. Vellum made it incredibly easy to map out complex evaluation paths using a visual builder and export it straight into Flask with a single CLI command.

### üß≠ Workflow Overview: `router_classifier`

The workflow works like an intelligent, AI-powered hiring assistant:

1. **Resume + Job Description Ingest**  
   Candidates submit their resume alongside a job posting. The input is parsed and passed into Vellum.

2. **EvaluateResume Node**  
   The AI evaluates whether the resume aligns with the job's core requirements‚Äîno brittle keyword matching.

3. **Branching Logic**  
   - If a match is found, the flow routes to `WriteNextRoundEmail`.
   - Otherwise, it uses `WriteRejectionEmail` to compose polite, constructive feedback.

4. **FinalOutputEmailContent Node**  
   No matter the route, the result is a polished, recruiter-quality message that you‚Äôd be proud to send.

## üß† Why Vellum Was a Game-Changer

As a student building this in a hackathon, Vellum was a total lifesaver for quickly turning an idea into a working AI-powered app:

- **Visual, Low-Code Workflow Builder**  
  Instead of writing tons of backend code, I used Vellum‚Äôs drag-and-drop interface to design complex AI logic super fast‚Äîno deep AI engineering needed.

- **Instant Deployment & Easy Integration**  
  With just a few CLI commands, I pulled the workflow right into my Flask backend, saving hours of setup and allowing me to focus on the user experience.

- **Flexible, Modular AI Components**  
  Vellum‚Äôs nodes made it easy to create branching logic that handles resume evaluation and personalized email generation in a way that feels smart and natural.

- **Built-in Versioning & Monitoring**  
  Even during rapid prototyping, I could track how the AI was performing and tweak prompts confidently without worrying about breaking anything.

- **Mix and Match AI Models Without Hassle**  
  I didn‚Äôt have to integrate multiple APIs manually‚ÄîVellum handled that behind the scenes, which made the AI responses better and more reliable.

- **Accessible for Non-Experts**  
  Because Vellum lets non-engineers experiment with prompt chains visually, I could iterate quickly and deliver a polished product in a short time.

Thanks to Vellum, I built a professional-quality AI workflow for resume analysis and recruiter feedback *way* faster than if I‚Äôd coded it all myself‚Äîperfect for hackathon speed and scope.

## üöÄ Summary

Building an AI hiring assistant from scratch would normally take weeks of prompt engineering, error handling, and infrastructure work. With **Vellum AI**, it took less than a weekend.

This project shows how powerful‚Äîand accessible‚Äîmodern AI tooling has become. With Vellum‚Äôs router workflows and CLI tooling, we were able to ship a full-featured recruiter feedback system that‚Äôs respectful, smart, and fast.

It doesn't just automate hiring‚Äîit makes it more **thoughtful**.
